                This audit checks that auth domain membership is appropriate for the current point in the upload cycle.
                Membership is expected to be as follows.
                <ul>
                    <li>Before the combined workspace is completed:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>GREGOR_DCC_ADMINS (as admin)</li>
                      <li>GREGOR_DCC_WRITERS</li>
                      <li>GREGOR_DCC_MEMBERS</li>
                      <li>The upload group for the Research Center associated with this upload workspace</li>
                      <li>The member group for the Research Center associated with this upload workspace</li>
                      <li>The non-member group for the Research Center associated with this upload workspace</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>After the combined workspace is completed:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>GREGOR_DCC_ADMINS (as admin)</li>
                      <li>GREGOR_ALL</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
